1. What is NLP?
    => NLP enables machine to understand, interpret and respond to human language.  

Key Components of NLP   
    -Tokenization
    -Part of Speech Tagging
    -Named Entity Recognition
    -Syntax and parsing
    -Semantics

Branches of NLP
    -Speech Technologies
    -Language Processing

Speech Technologies: 
    ASR (Automatic speech Recognition):
        -Converts speech to text
    TTS (Text to Speech)
        -Converts Text to speech

Understanding Language Processing Technologies
    1) Machine Translation
    2) Question Answerin
    3) Web Search and Text Classification

Rational Decision: 
    - logically, systematically and based on availabe information. 
    -  Aim to achieve best possible outcomes. 
    -   Analyse cost , benefits, risks and alternatives to arrive an optimal solution. 

AI agent: 
    -System that percieves its environment and acts to achieve a goal. 
    -plan ahead.

Types of AI agent: 
    Reflex Agent: 
        This agent make the decision based on the current input rather than analysing the best possible outcomes based on previous data. 

    Rational Agent: 
        Makes best decision based on the availabe old data and find out the best possible outcomes. 
    

Can Reflex Agent Ever be Rational?
    - yes, but only in limited environment. To be rational we need to store the previous decision made and planning and goal based decision making 
        which are not the components of the reflex agent. 
    
Lets move to Planning and Replanning. 
    -Sequence of Actions to achieve a goal before execution begins. 
    -Different from Reflex Agents 
    -It consider future consequences.
