What is AI?
AI is the simualtion of human intelligence in machines. It enables computers to learn, reason and make decision. 

Types Of AI: 
    Reactive AI - No memory, only reacts to current input. 
    Limited memory AI - Can learn from past data but does not retain it permanently
    Theory of Mind AI - Understands emotions, beliefs
    Self-Aware AI - AI with conciousness

AI problem - solving approaches

Search Algorithms - BFS, DFS, A*
Knowledge Representation - Logic based AI 
Machine learning - Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning. 

Search Algorithms
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search 


A star Search Algorithm: 
    Why do we need A Search? 
        - Bfs find the shortest path within the unweighted graph. 
        - A star is used in pathfinding in weighted graphs, commonly  seen in AI, games and robotics. 
        - It combines: 
            g(n) : Cost from start to current node. 
            h(n) : Heuristic estimate from current node to goal. 
            f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
            Example: 
            S . . X .
            . X . X .
            . . . . G

        Imagine we have this grid map where S is the starting point and X are the blocks and our goal is to find the 
        shortest distance between S and G while avoiding obstacles.    
    From the given graph our expected result will be: 
        A* Path: ['S', 'A', 'C', 'G']
